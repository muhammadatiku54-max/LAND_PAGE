            <h3>The Concept of Software Yield</h3>
            <p>Recurring SaaS Nodes represent the ultimate goal of the "Terminal-Wealth" philosophy: building once and earning forever.
                 A "node" is a single-purpose software tool—like a custom API, a Chrome extension, or a data processing script—that solves a persistent problem for a niche audience. 
                By hosting these nodes on scalable cloud infrastructure, you create a digital asset that produces a monthly "yield" in the form of subscription fees.</p>

            <h3>Micro-SaaS and Market Agility</h3>
            <p>The power of this model lies in its modularity. Instead of building one massive, complex software suite, you build several smaller
                 "nodes" that can be quickly pivoted or updated based on AI-driven market feedback. This minimizes risk and ensures that even if one node becomes obsolete, your overall portfolio continues to generate wealth.
                  Coding these nodes using modern frameworks ensures they remain fast and easy to maintain.</p>

            <h3>The Compounding Effect of Subscriptions</h3>
            <p>Generating money online through SaaS nodes is a game of compounding growth. 
                Because the software is automated, your overhead remains low while your user base grows. By integrating affiliate links inside your software nodes
                 (for example, a coding tool that recommends a specific hosting provider), you create a double-stream of income:
                  the subscription fee and the affiliate commission, maximizing the revenue of every single user.</p>
